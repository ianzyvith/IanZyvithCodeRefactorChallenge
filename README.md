# Challenge Goal
To take the starter html and css code and make sure that everything in the site is functioning properly. 

To ensure that all code is written semantically for highest accessibility.

# What was done
Tags were changed from "div" to things such as "header" and "section" in order to more easily differentiate what was happening throughout the code.

Css styles and classes were also adjusted to be more concise and less repetitive.
