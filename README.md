# Challenge Goal
to take the starter html and css code and make sure that everything the site is functioning properly as well as written semantically

# What was done
tags were changed from "div" to things such as "header" and "section" in order to more easily differentiate what was happening throughout the code

css styles and classes were also adjusted to be more concise and less repetitive
